\section{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

	Komondor \cite{barrachina2017komondor} is an event-based simulator based on COST \cite{chen2002reusing}, and which is mostly intended to reproduce the novel techniques included in the IEEE 802.11ax-2019 amendment \cite{tgax2017draft}.
	
	In this document, we aim to illustrate the installation and execution procedures that must be carried out to successfully perform Komondor simulations. The main goal is therefore to encourage researchers and other practitioners to use the Komondor simulator for their own experiments, and even to participate in the project.	
	
	For more detailed information about the IEEE 802.11-based functionalities that are implemented in Komondor, please refer to \href{https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor/blob/master/Documentation/Tutorial/LaTeX\%20files/komondor_technical_report.pdf}{this} document.
	
	\textbf{Disclaimer:} Komondor is a project that is constantly evolving, and the contents provided in this document are subject to changes.
	
	%%% Overview
	\subsection{Overview of Komondor}
	\label{section:flowchart}
	Komondor is composed by several modules that allow performing simulations with a high degree of freedom. Here we provide a general overview on the most important module, which are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:komondor_flowchart}.
	\begin{figure}[h!]
		\centering
		\epsfig{file=images/komondor_flowchart, width=15cm}
		\caption{Komondor flowchart}
		\label{fig:komondor_flowchart}
	\end{figure}		
	
	Komondor receives a set of inputs (information about the nodes, system configuration, simulation time, etc.) and initializes the main module (i.e., \textit{komondor.cc}), which is in charge of generating the network and collecting the information generated within the simulation time. In particular, \textit{komondor.cc} initializes each node in the network (\textit{node.h} components), which act as independent entities and generate data on their own. As a result, during the core simulation, nodes interact among each other by sending packets, so that the DCF operation is implemented for accessing to the channel. Finally, when the simulation runs out (the simulation time is over), a set of outputs are generated with regards to network performance.
	
	The input and output layers are described with more detail later in Sections \ref{section:input} and \ref{section:output}.
	
	% Files organization
	\subsection{Files Organization}
	\label{section:files}		
	To properly understand the Komondor's operation, it is important to know how the project allocated in \href{https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor}{Github} is organized. In particular, the project is divided into three main folders: \textit{Apps}, \textit{Code} and \textit{Documentation}. \textit{Apps} and \textit{Documentation} folders are intended to contain additional material that supplements the core Komondor's infrastructure (this document, for instance, is inside the \textit{Documentation} folder). Here we focus on the code part, which is organized as follows (refer to Figure \ref{fig:komondor_files} as well):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{COST}: constitute the Komondor's primitive operation. Here we find the CompC++ library that allows generating discrete event simulations. For further information about COST, please refer to its main \href{http://www.ita.cs.rpi.edu/cost.html}{website}. 
		\item \textbf{main}: contains the core files (\texttt{komondor.cc}, \texttt{node.h}, \texttt{agent.h} and \texttt{central\_controller.h}) that are in charge of orchestrating all the simulation.  \texttt{komondor.cc} is the main component, which initializes all the other components of \textit{Type II}. All these modules are aware of the existence of the simulation time. In addition to the core components, here we find \texttt{build\_local}, a bash script that compiles the libraries for executing the code. Note that file \texttt{compcxx\_komondor\_main.h} is also required to carry out such a compilation.
		\item \textbf{methods}: by following clean architecture guidelines, independent methods used by core files are contained in the methods folder. Several libraries are provided according to the nature of their functions. For instance, \texttt{backoff\_methods.h} contains methods to handle the backoff operation in DCF.
		\item \textbf{structures}: the Komondor simulator considers several header files to carry out its operation. Among them, we find \texttt{wlan.h}, which defines the main characteristics of a WLAN (WLAN id, list of associated STAs, etc.). In addition, the \texttt{notification.h} structure allows to define the information to be exchanged between devices. 
		\item \textbf{learning\_modules}: here we find the implementation of Machine Learning (ML) methods that receive feedback about the networks performance in simulation time. The utilization of learning mechanisms is further described later in Section \ref{section:input_learning_agents}. 
		\item \textbf{list\_of\_macros.h}: all the static parameters (e.g., constants) are contained in this file.
		\item \textbf{input}: contains the input files that allow building the simulation environment.
		\item \textbf{output}: contains the data generated by Komondor as a result of a given simulation.	
		\item \textbf{scripts\_multiple\_executions}: contains bash scripts to perform multiple simulations.
	\end{itemize}

% INSTALLATION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Installation and Environment Setup}

Komondor strictly depends on the CompC++ library provided by COST. Therefore, the simulator has been conceived to operate in a Linux environment. In particular, Ubuntu 16.04 is strongly recommended, since Komondor has been fully tested in such an OS version. In addition, 64-bit system are highly recommended.\footnote{An error may be displayed in compilation time for 32-bit architecture computers. To solve it, introduce the following commands: 1) \texttt{sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386}, 2) \texttt{sudo apt-get update}, and 3) \texttt{sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386}.}

The steps to install Komondor are detailed below:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item First of all, it is required to have the GCC compiler installed. Further details can be obtained from the official \href{http://gcc.gnu.org/install/}{website}.
	\item Download the source code of Komondor available in the \href{https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor/tree/master/Code}{Github repository}.
	\item In case that the user does not have permissions to execute some of the files, grant them by introducing the following command in the target folder: \texttt{\$ chmod -R 777 *}
	\item Test that Komondor can be compiled by executing the \texttt{build\_local} compilation script (more details in Section \ref{section:execution}).
 \end{enumerate}

% EXECUTION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Compilation and Execution}
\label{section:execution}
Here we provide the guidelines to properly compile and execute the Komondor simulator. First, we show the execution modes available, and then we describe both the input and the output of the system.

%%% Execution
\subsection{Execution Modes}
\label{section:execution_modes}
To compile and execute Komondor, the following instructions must be followed\footnote{A GNU-based OS is assumed to be used for simulations, including basic compilation programs such as \emph{gcc}.}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Set the .csv input files (further defined in Section \ref{section:input})
	\item Access to the "main" directory
	\item Execute "./build\_local". This file contains the instructions for compiling the Komondor code. It has been updated to enable debugging with Valgrind\footnote{Valgrind is a programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling. Valgrind main website: \url{http://valgrind.org/}}.
	\item Execute \textit{./KomondorSimulator arg\_1 arg\_2 ... arg\_n}, where \textit{arg\_i} is the $i_{\text{th}}$ input argument.
	\item Collect the results either in the output files or in the console.
\end{enumerate}

The execution mode of Komondor depends on the provided input files and the arguments introduced by console. The full list of parameters is described in Table \ref{table:arguments}, and the currently implemented execution modes are summarized below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Basic execution:} simulates the operation of basic WLANs, according to the parameters indicated in the system and nodes input files. Arguments [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13] are required for the basic execution.
	\item \textbf{Quick execution:} allows to perform the basic execution by introducing only few parameters. Only the mandatory arguments are required for this kind of execution.
	\item \textbf{Script-based execution:} in this case, the execution is ordered by a bash script, which uses arguments [1, 2, 5, 12, 13].
	\item \textbf{Execution with agents:} in case of including agents, additional parameters must be added to inform about the necessary information that enables the creation of agents. In this case, all the arguments are required to be specified at the console.
\end{itemize}

%%% INPUT
\subsection{Input}
\label{section:input}	
The input files allow Komondor to generate the simulation environment. In particular, we find three main types of input files, which are described in the following subsections.

% System
\subsubsection{System input}
\label{section:system_input}
The system input is introduced through a .csv file, and defines global input parameters such as the number of basic channels considered or the propagation models. System input parameters are defined in Table \ref{table:system_parameters}.

%  System input parameters	
\begin{table}[h!]

An example of system input file can be found in the Github repository:  \href{https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor/blob/master/Code/input/input_example/input_system_conf.csv}{\textit{Komondor/Code/input/input\_example/input\_system\_conf.csv}}.

% Nodes
\subsubsection{Nodes input}
\label{section:nodes_input}	
Each WLAN is built according to the nodes input, which can define both Access Points (APs) and stations (STAs). In particular, the nodes input introduces characteristics such as type of device, location, or implementing features (e.g., DCB policy). There are two ways of generating nodes, which is explicitly indicated to Komondor through the file name:
\begin{itemize}
	\item In case of including the keyword \emph{nodes}, all the devices (both APs and STAs) must be introduced and described.
	\item Otherwise, if including the keyword \emph{aps}, only the APs are defined, so that a set of STAs is randomly generated under certain introduced parameters (e.g., minimum/maximum number of STAs, maximum distance between APs and STA).\footnote{The usage of APs input files is discouraged to the lack of maintenance.}
\end{itemize}

Table \ref{table:nodes_parameters} describes the Nodes input parameters for both \emph{nodes} and \emph{aps} files.

	\end{tabular}
	\end{scriptsize}
	\caption{Nodes input parameters description.}
	\label{table:nodes_parameters}
\end{table}

As a final remark, in order to ensure a proper execution, it is mandatory to introduce an input file with a list of nodes ordered by \textit{node\_id} and starting with \textit{node\_id} = 0 (it is a requirement for the array responsible of storing the power perceived by each node). An example of nodes input file can be found in the Github repository:  \href{https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor/blob/master/Code/input/input_example/input_nodes.csv}{\textit{Komondor/Code/input/input\_example/input\_nodes.csv}}.

% Agents
\subsubsection{Agents input}
\label{section:input_learning_agents}		

Apart from the system and nodes definition, a given user may make use of the learning modules included in Komondor. To that end, the agents input file must be defined, so that specific agents' characteristics (e.g., associated WLAN, learning mechanism or modifiable parameters) are introduced. Table \ref{table:agents_parameters} describes the agents input parameters.

\begin{table}[]

In particular, an agent may act on its own or be part of a centralized system. At the current development stage, the central entity is not fully programmed, and would require from an additional dedicated input file to indicate its operational details. When it comes to the learning mechanisms, so far the \texttt{multi\_armed\_bandits} module is available, which has id 1. Future developments are expected to contemplate the implementation of other Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques such as Q-learning or Neural Networks. To that end, interactions with other software systems are being contemplated.

An example of agents input file can be found in the Github repository:  \href{https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor/blob/master/Code/input/input_example/agents.csv}{\textit{Komondor/Code/input/input\_example/agents.csv}}.

% Input scripts
\subsubsection{Input scripts}
\label{section:input_scripts}	
In order to facilitate users work, we provide a set of scripts that allow performing several simulations at once, which is useful to avoid processing different output files. Such sample scripts can be found in the ``scripts multiple executions'' folder, which perform the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{multiple\_inputs\_script.sh}: processes all the input files contained in ./input/script\_input\_files and generates a simulation for each one. 
	\item \emph{multiple\_inputs\_script\_several\_seeds.sh}: in addition to process multiple inputs, generates different seeds for each simulation.
\end{itemize}

Similar procedures can be implemented to extend the current provided functionalities, such as reading multiple system inputs or generating specific output reports.

%%% OUTPUT
\subsection{Output}
\label{section:output}
The results collected by Komondor can be analyzed after its execution through the generated output. Two information sources are provided: \emph{i)} console logs, and \emph{ii)} logs saved in separated files. The logs generation can be enabled/disabled through the arguments passed to Komondor by console (refer to Section \ref{section:execution_modes}). Note, as well, that major increases in the execution time may occur if logging is activated. For example, for a basic simulation of 4 nodes, simulating 1,000 seconds takes 1.12 s and 15.67 s when not logging and when doing so, respectively.

% Output logs
\subsubsection{Output logs}
\label{section:output_logs}

Komondor, by default, generates a set of console logs regarding the current simulation. For completeness, additional logs can be displayed in relation to node statistics. Such statistics include throughput experienced, collisions, nodes sent, RTS/CTS sent, etc. An example of nodes and system statistics is shown in Figures \ref{fig:nodes_statistics_example} and \ref{fig:general_statistics_example}.

\end{figure}

% Output files
\subsubsection{Output files}
\label{section:output_files}	
Each node can generate logs about its activity, thus describing its IEEE 802.11 operation and the interaction with the other nodes. Such an information is copied into files, which are saved into the \emph{output} folder. In addition agent output files can be generated, thus providing information about the learning procedures.

Finally, in order to make the output files more understandable and classifiable, logs are categorized according to the event that generates it. With that, further filtering processes can be carried out by developers. A potential application may be a network animator. Table \ref{table:event_coding} describes the codes used for each type of event.

%%% Example
\subsection{Execution examples}
\label{section:examples}
Here we provide few execution examples with the aim of clarifying the information provided along this section.

\subsubsection{Example 1: Basic execution}
For this simulation, we use the system and nodes input files that can be found at the \href{https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor/tree/master/Code/input/input_example}{``input\_example''} folder.

The first step is to compile the code through the \texttt{build\_local} file. For that, we access to the ``main'' folder and execute:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ cd Komondor/Code/main
$ ./build_local
\end{lstlisting}

Once the code is compiled without errors, execute the simulation as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ ./komondor_main ../input/input_example/system_input.csv ../input/input_example/nodes_input.csv 0 0 1 1 60 789
\end{lstlisting}

In this case, the execution time has been set to 60 seconds and the random seed to 789. File logs have been disabled (the two zeros), but console logs were activated. The results of this simulation can be observed from the console (Figure \ref{fig:example_1_console_output}). Moreover, logs specific to individual WLAN's performance are shown (Figure \ref{fig:example_1_console_output_wlans}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\epsfig{file=images/example_1_console_output, width=12cm}
	\caption{Output logs from example 1.}
	\label{fig:example_1_console_output}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\epsfig{file=images/example_1_console_output_wlans, width=12cm}
	\caption{Output logs for individual WLANs from example 1.}
	\label{fig:example_1_console_output_wlans}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Example 2: Execution with agents}
Now, we are showing an execution where intelligent agents are used. For that, we use the same system and input files, and add the agents input file that is located at the same \href{https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor/tree/master/Code/input/input_example}{folder}. In this case, we use Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs) under an $\varepsilon$-greedy action-selection strategy to allow the WLANs to modify the transmit power and the CCA. For additional details on the application of MABs to wireless networks, please refer to \cite{wilhelmi2017collaborative, wilhelmi2018potential}.

Again, we compile the code as before:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ cd Komondor/Code/main
$ ./build_local
\end{lstlisting}

To execute the simulation, we now introduce more arguments, as described in Section \ref{section:input}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ ./komondor_main ../input/input_example/system_input.csv ../input/input_example/nodes_input.csv ../input/input_example/agents.csv 1 1 1 1 1 1 120 432
\end{lstlisting}

In this occasion, we activated all the types of logs, so the output folder will contain files generated by the system, the nodes and the agents (Figure \ref{fig:output_folder}). Moreover, logs regarding agents' initialization are written at the console, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:example_2_console_output}.
