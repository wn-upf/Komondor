# COST: Component Oriented Simulation Toolkit

A brief documentation of COST is available at
http://www.ita.cs.rpi.edu/cost.html. Unfortunately, the source code is not
available from this website anymore. The Comp++ source code was extracted from
[SENSE](http://www.ita.cs.rpi.edu/). The SENSE source code is available at
http://ita.cs.rpi.edu/download/.

## Build CompC++
Following instructions require [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html).

To build the `cxx` binary, just run `make` in this directory:

```
$ make
```
